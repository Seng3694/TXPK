# Example #

This is an example of how the packed atlas files could be used.

## Resources ##

All used resources are just for illustration purposes. 
Graphics are from [Jesse M.][1].
The font is from [Pizzadude][4].

Packed atlas created by the [TexturePacker][2]:

Notice the rotated textures.

The example app loads the sprites and animates them.

### How rotation is handled in the TexturePacker ###

![rotation][7]

The texture gets rotated by 90Â° and then the origin will be moved 

```cpp
if(texture.flip == true)
{
    sprite.setRotation(90);
    sprite.setOrigin(0, texture.width); 
}
//source: https://github.com/Seng3694/TexturePacker/blob/master/engine/src/ImageRenderer.cpp
```

This step has to be reversed:

```cpp
if (texture.flip == true)
{
    sprite.setOrigin(texture.height, 0);
    sprite.setRotation(-90);
}
//source: https://github.com/Seng3694/TexturePacker/blob/master/example/src/Animation.cpp
```

### Does this litter my code with rotation hacks? ###
The sprites are stored in an `AnimatedSprite` class which has it's own transform. When drawing the `AnimatedSprite` to the screen the transform will be combined with the backing sprite. So no one using this class would ever notice the rotation applied while loading the texture.
